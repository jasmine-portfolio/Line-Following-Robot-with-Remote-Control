# Line Following Robot with Remote Control

This project implements a line-following robot using the TMS320F28379D microcontroller, with wireless remote control functionality via an ESP32 module. The robot uses PID control to follow a line based on sensor feedback. Its speed and other parameters can be remotely adjusted. The system also sends RPM and power consumption data back to the remote controller.

The line-following robot uses encoders to measure wheel speed and reflective sensors to detect the line. This project is ideal for learning about embedded systems, motor control, and communication between devices.

## üèóÔ∏è How It Works

The system operates through a combination of peripherals, periodic tasks, interrupts, and a control loop. Here's a breakdown of its operation:

### 1. **System Initialization**

- **Peripherals Setup**: Initializes various system peripherals, including:
    - **PWM** for motor control.
    - **ADC** for measuring power consumption.
    - **UART** for serial communication between the robot and external devices (e.g., ESP32).

### 2. **Periodic Tasks (Timer-Triggered)**

- **PID Control Loop (every 1ms - `control_loop_swi`)**:
    - The reflective array sensors are polled to determine which sensor is triggered.
    - Based on this sensor data, the error (deviation from the path) is calculated.
    - The **PID algorithm** adjusts the PWM motor speeds to correct the robot‚Äôs movement and maintain its desired trajectory.
- **Data Transmission (every 1s - `txData_swi`)**:
    - Every second, the robot calculates its **power consumption** and sends both **RPM** and **power data** to an external controller (like the ESP32) for monitoring.

### 3. **Interrupts**

- **Encoder Speed Calculation (via GPIO XINT - `encoder_hwi`)**:
    - The system tracks the motor speed by measuring encoder pulses.
    - The time difference between successive encoder pulses is used to calculate the **RPM** (Revolutions Per Minute) of each motor.
- **Serial Communication Reception (via GPIO RX - `sci_rx_hwi`)**:
    - Commands are received from an external controller (e.g., ESP32) via UART.
    - These commands control various aspects of the robot, such as its state, speed, and speaker settings.

### 4. **Idle State (via `myIdleFxn`)**

- **Heartbeat LED**: The system has a heartbeat indicator‚Äîa red LED that flashes to show the system is running.

## üïπÔ∏è Control Modes

- **PID Control**: The robot autonomously adjusts motor speed to follow the line. You can adjust the PID constants via the remote control.
- **Manual Control**: The robot's state (on/off) can be switched remotely, and its speed can be set using the ESP32.

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

- **If the robot is not following the line properly**:
    - Check the alignment and calibration of the reflective sensors.
    - Adjust the PID constants for better line-following performance.
- **If the remote control is not working**:
    - Ensure that the ESP32 is properly paired and communicating with the TMS320F28379D.
    - Verify the UART connection between the ESP32 and the TMS320F28379D is set up correctly.
    - Make sure the watchdog timer is disabled
